im making a 2d metaverse app with gamified workspace in nextjs , js using mongodb for storage and auth0 for authentication soo users have a dashboard were they can create a workspace and link thier other social accounts like github and google accounts after authenticaiton using linking feature of auth0 

and when they enter the workspace , they have a 2d map using phaserjs they can move around and all, then when they share the link other users can join that workspace too , when they come in contact with each other a chat option apears they can have a chat with them, or video call them like sort of meeting , and there are areas defined like a meeting area where they can go and ping everyone for a meeting , a chat area, a provate dnd area where they ownt recieve anything , and the leader who created the workspace can add or ban members , and one more important thing , i want to use github idk how like im using link accounts from auth0 then idk who to do but i want that the leader or user in the workspace area can create a repo directly from there add collaboraters view commit history, and they can create a todo like the tasks to do with a deadline and when complemted the leader or owner of workspace can pay them with blockchain or something by connecting thier wallets through auth0 only



Alright! This project has amazing potential and is exactly the type of innovation that can stand out in hackathons. Let's break down your vision, refine it, suggest enhancements, and outline the tech stack with libraries for a smooth implementation. I'll also suggest some advanced features that could increase your chances of winning.

ðŸ“‹ Project Overview (Refined)
You're building a 2D Metaverse-based Gamified Workspace Platform where users can:

Authenticate using Auth0 (supporting Google, GitHub, and Web3 wallet connections).
Create, manage, and link workspaces to their social accounts, specifically GitHub, to integrate project management features.
Collaborate in a 2D virtual office powered by PhaserJS, allowing users to move around, chat, and interact with each other in real-time.
Share workspace links for others to join. Users can:
Chat and video call other users upon proximity.
Use designated areas for meetings, DND (Do Not Disturb) mode, and casual chats.
Create tasks and To-Dos, with payments upon task completion via blockchain.
Manage GitHub repositories directly within the workspace (create repos, view commit history, add collaborators).
Reward users with cryptocurrency by connecting wallets through Auth0.
ðŸ“š Libraries & Tools Breakdown
1. Next.js (latest version with App Router)
Why: Ideal for full-stack applications, server-side rendering, and API routes.
What: Use for routing, API management, and handling server-side logic.
2. Auth0
Why: Secure authentication with social account linking (Google, GitHub, Web3 wallets).
What: Use Auth0's Account Linking feature to manage multiple linked identities.
Docs: Auth0 Account Linking
3. PhaserJS
Why: For rendering the 2D virtual workspace and handling player movements/interactions.
What: Use Phaserâ€™s Arcade Physics for player movement and collisions, WebSocket for real-time interactions, and camera control for focused views.
Docs: PhaserJS Docs
4. WebRTC (for Video Calls)
Why: Real-time video communication between users.
What: Use peer-to-peer WebRTC connections with Socket.IO as a signaling server.
5. MongoDB + Mongoose
Why: For data storage, including user profiles, workspaces, chats, tasks, and linked accounts.
What: Use for handling user data, workspace info, task management, and chat history.
6. Socket.IO
Why: For real-time communication, multiplayer interactions, and notifications.
What: Handle player connections, chat messaging, and workspace notifications.
7. GitHub API
Why: Integrate repository creation, commit history, and collaborator management.
What: Use GitHub OAuth for authentication and REST API for repo management.
Docs: GitHub REST API
8. Blockchain (Ethereum + MetaMask)
Why: Reward users with cryptocurrency for task completions.
What: Use MetaMask for wallet connections, and Ethers.js or web3.js to handle transactions.
9. Tailwind CSS & DaisyUI
Why: For fast, responsive UI design.
What: Create modern and user-friendly interfaces with minimal effort.
ðŸš€ Step-by-Step Implementation Plan
1. Authentication & Social Account Linking
Set up Auth0 with Google, GitHub, and MetaMask wallet authentication.
Use Auth0 Rules to link multiple accounts.
Store user data and linked accounts in MongoDB.
2. 2D Virtual Workspace (PhaserJS)
Create a 2D map for the workspace using a tileset.
Implement character movement and collision detection for interaction zones.
Use Socket.IO to broadcast player positions and interactions.
Integrate chat and video call options using WebRTC when users come into proximity.
3. Workspace Management & GitHub Integration
Allow the workspace leader to create GitHub repositories, add collaborators, and monitor commits.
Integrate with the GitHub API using access tokens obtained during the Auth0 linking process.
Display commit history, pull requests, and repository details in the workspace dashboard.
4. Task Management & Blockchain Payments
Implement a To-Do list with deadlines, status tracking, and reward conditions.
Connect usersâ€™ wallets (using MetaMask) for crypto payments on task completion.
Use Ethers.js to handle blockchain transactions directly from the app.
5. Notifications & Messaging
Use Socket.IO to handle notifications for chats, task updates, and meeting reminders.
Allow users to enter DND mode where they won't receive notifications.
ðŸŒŸ Additional Features to Stand Out
Customizable Avatars: Allow users to customize their avatars in the virtual workspace.
Real-Time Collaborative Whiteboard: Add a shared whiteboard for brainstorming and note-taking.
Task Analytics Dashboard: Track user performance, task completion rates, and crypto rewards.
Leaderboards & Badges: Gamify the workspace by introducing leaderboards and badges for task completion.
AI-powered Task Assistant: Use AI (like Google Gemini or OpenAI API) to automatically generate task descriptions, summaries, or code snippets.
Voice Channels: Implement voice channels for spontaneous group discussions (using WebRTC).
Integration with Calendar Apps: Sync tasks and meetings with Google Calendar or Outlook.
ðŸ”§ Technical Challenges & Solutions
Real-Time Collaboration: Leverage Socket.IO and WebRTC for scalability and low latency.
GitHub Integration Security: Use environment variables and Auth0 securely to manage GitHub access tokens.
Scalability: Optimize MongoDB indexing and caching strategies for quick data retrieval.
